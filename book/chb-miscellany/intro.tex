There have been a number of times in the book where we have avoided delving too deeply into the more technical or obscure aspects of a definition or proof. Usually this was because exploring these aspects was not central to the topic at hand, or because the details involved were sufficiently messy that providing all the details would obfuscate the main ideas being discussed.

This appendix provides a home for the comments we didn't make, the theorems we didn't prove, the details we didn't provide and the obscurities we didn't explore.

We begin with a quick glance at the \textit{foundations of mathematics} in \Cref{secZFC}. We will provide the axioms for Zermelo--Fraenkel set theory (ZF), which encodes all mathematical objects as sets and allows us to derive all mathematical objects from a collection of axioms. We will also demonstrate how to encode natural numbers, integers, rational numbers and complex numbers within this framework.
